For my 25th Birthday, I am trying to support <a href="https://www.jaipurfoot.org">Jaipur Foot (BMVSS)</a>. Their goal is to provide prosthetic limbs, calipers and other physical aids to people with limb-related disabilities. Till date, they have applied 650,000+ prosthetic limbs, 150,000+ wheelchairs, 7000+ surgeries, and many other services. All their services are free of charge.<br><br>

Growing up, my high school was next to their clinic and I often saw people walking out with a prosthetic limb or a wheelchair. It has been very inspirational to see the impact they've had on people's lives. I will contribute INR 25,000/-, and match 10% of the amount raised through this campaign. My goal is to raise a total of INR 500,000/-.<br><br>
