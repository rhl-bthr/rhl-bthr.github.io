##### Bio
I am working with Prof. Brighten Godfrey on localizing faults more effeciently in the datacenter, and using formal reasoning to design and optimize networks. Previously, I worked at Microsoft Research on improving resource utilization for Microsoft Teams, which reduced their operational costs by ~$10M per year.
<br>Here is my [academic ancestry](academic-ancestry).

##### Random
I like to work out, play chess, and go for runs. As part of my new-year resolution, I dedicate some time to [_learn random things_](jack-of-no-trades).

I am trying to [support Jaipur Foot](25-birthday-pledge), an NGO aiming to help people with limb-related disabilities - please consider contributing.

##### Credits
My parents made many sacrifices to support my decisions, both personal and academic. My advisors gave me opportunities to grow as a researcher, as well as patiently helped steer me in the right directions. For who I am and what I have to offer, I owe it all to them.
