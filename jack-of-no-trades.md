I am generally afraid of meeting new people, and was trying to fit in grad school. I guessed I'll be able to connect with people if I tried new things (spoiler: it didn't work). But I started to find comfort in learning new things, so I made a list of _random interesting things_ that I can't do, and which can be learned to an intermediate level in a 2-4 weeks. 

I plan to dedicate time on a [_best-effort_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-effort_delivery) basis. Here's how the progress has been so far.
