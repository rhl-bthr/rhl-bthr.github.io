title: "PhD Applications Experience"
---

I applied to 10 schools, interviewed with 8, and got admission offers from 5. I decided to go to UIUC. I got great inputs from my peers and mentors on my application. I've tried to summarize my experience and the advice I received.

### Proficiency Tests
All US schools ask for TOEFL scores. A handful of them also ask for GRE scores. Typically, these scores don't matter beyond a certain cut-off. GRE Verbal takes about ~2 weeks to prepare. TOEFL, if given after GRE should take ~2 days to prepare. It's a good idea to be done with these tests in advance (I completed them by 30th September).

### Which schools to apply to?
I looked at [csrankings](https://csrankings.org) for schools with a strong Systems group. Amongst those schools, I looked for professors who would be fun to work with. I applied to schools where I found multiple such professors. PhD is a big commitment; a good advice I got was to NOT apply to schools just as a _safe bet_, but to apply to places I would be excited to go to.

[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OFfrQ2872aVTqMkbLEmLR0uxay2BYwdT6_4J8j7kXDM/edit?usp=sharing) is the sheet where I tracked the list of schools and my application progress.

### Statement of Purpose
[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T3qaQf_L9T2bOLDlMVMPRbbWFEoniBYT/view?usp=sharing) is my SOP. I used a standard template -- a quick intro, followed by relevant projects and my undergraduate experiences, and concluding with a tailored paragraph for each university.

The goal of the SOP is to help the professor evaluate if you'll succeed as a PhD student. Read your SOP as to how each sentence helps professors gauge that. 
For example, I would get tempted to explain my projects in detail, because I wanted to highlight the effort that went into them. I received feedback from my mentors that goal of this section should only be to highlight the technical/non-technical skills learnt from working on those projects, and not the project details themselves.

Try to keep the SOP short. Professors have a finite amount of time to go through each application, and you shouldn't dilute your SOP with too much content. Thankfully, I had the attention span of a 2-year old, so my thumb rule was to cut down on text till I could read it in one go. A good question to ask yourself is - _Will the professor really care about this sentence?_


Aditya Chetan (PhD student at Cornell) has written an amazing, and more detailed, [SOP guide](https://justachetan.github.io/blog/2022/grad-school-apps/).


### Personal Statement
Many schools ask for a personal statement, describing the challenges you faced, what makes you passionate about research, and what other things do you care about. [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GpvUwb9NtKxghcJqAOOXrCPmQ4t2x9rE/view?usp=sharing) is my Personal Statement. All the schools I applied to asked a subset of these points, so I only had to make slight modifications for each school.

### Contacting Professors
I typically emailed professors either once or twice. The first email was 2-4 weeks before the application deadline, to ask if the professor is hiring. The second email was after New Year, to remind them to go through my application. Here is a sample email,

```
Hi Prof. X,

I am working as a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research with Venkat Padmanabhan on Networking problems. Link to my CV: https://rahulbothra.com/cv.pdf

I have applied to Berkeley's Ph.D program and mentioned your name in my application. I am interested in your recent work (Skyplane, cross-mesh sharding) and would like to work on similar problems.

I was hoping we could chat more if you think I'll be a good fit.

Thank you,
Rahul Bothra
```

### Letters of Recommendation
I submitted 3 letters - 2 from my advisors at MSR, and 1 from my undergrad advisor. I asked my letter-writers in mid-October if they were willing to write me a strong letter. I talked to 3 more advisors in case I needed backup letter(s).

People have different opinions on the number of letters - some people suggest sticking to the strongest three letters that you have, some suggest having as many letters as you can. I felt that more letters don't add a lot of value, but dilutes your package instead, since professors might not have time to go through all the letters.

Letter deadlines are loosely defined. Don't worry if your advisor decides to submit the letter at a later date.


### Application Reviews
My application improved significantly because of the reviews from my friends and mentors. Asking serially for reviews can take a lot of time, and parallel reviews might get you the same feedback 10 times over. So, I sent the first draft to all my friends (as a Drive link which I kept updating). I addressed their comments and sent the next version to all my colleagues. I repeated the same process and then sent the further-refined version to all my mentors. This process took about 10 days.


### How much advice is too much advice?
_"Suno sabki, karo apni"_.

You'll likely hear very different advice from different people. One of my advisors told me to submit 5 letters, whereas another told me to stick to 3. One of them told me to write about a certain project and the other told me to skip it. They also gave valid reasons for why they said it.

Similarly, you'll also notice that people who applied in the past had very different SOP templates. A good idea is to take advice and inputs from a reasonable number of people, but at the end, do what feels right to you!


### Urghhhh!
PhD applications can be stressful, and there might be some doubts or anxiousness about the process. If you want to chat, feel free to reach out to me on rrbothra@gmail.com. Good luck!
